# Simple Animations

Touying provides two markers for simple animation effects: `#pause` and `#meanwhile`.

## pause

The purpose of `#pause` is straightforward â€“ it separates the subsequent content into the next subslide. You can use multiple `#pause` to create multiple subslides. Here's a simple example:

```typst
#slide[
  First #pause Second

  #pause

  Third
]
```

This example will create three subslides, gradually revealing the content.

As you can see, `#pause` can be used inline or on a separate line.

## meanwhile

In some cases, you may need to display additional content simultaneously with `#pause`. In such cases, you can use `#meanwhile`.

```typst
#slide[
  First
  
  #pause
  
  Second

  #meanwhile

  Third

  #pause

  Fourth
]
```

This example will create only two subslides, with "First" and "Third" displayed simultaneously, and "Second" and "Fourth" displayed simultaneously.

## Handling set-show rules

If you use set-show rules inside `slide[..]`, you might be surprised to find that subsequent `#pause` and `#meanwhile` do not work. This is because Touying cannot detect the content inside `styled(..)` (content after set-show rules is encompassed by `styled`).

To address this issue, Touying provides a `setting` parameter for the `#slide()` function. You can place your set-show rules in the `setting` parameter. For example, changing the font color:

```typst
#slide(setting: body => {
  set text(fill: blue)
  body
})[
  First
  
  #pause
  
  Second
]
```

Similarly, Touying currently does not support `#pause` and `#meanwhile` inside layout functions like `grid`. This is due to the same limitation, but you can use the `composer` parameter of `#slide()` to meet most requirements.

:::tip[Internals]

Touying doesn't rely on `counter` and `locate` to implement `#pause`. Instead, it has a parser written in Typst script. It parses the input content block as a sequence and then transforms and reorganizes this sequence into the series of subslides we need.
